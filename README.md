# lldb-imgui
A hacky attempt at making Xcode's lldb-rpc-server render ImGui

At the moment this is nothing more than a crazy experiment meaning:
 - There is no support
 - Some project settings are specific to my installation
 - The code quality is not something I consider production ready :)

That said, if you too are interested in creating your own debugger GUI feel free to look around
